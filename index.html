<h1>
    My Dream Destination...
</h1>
<h2> 
    The Maldives are large archapeligo located in South Asia.
</h2>
<h3> 
    <p>You should go to the Maldives because of it's sunny and fresh environemnt. <br>
        The water surrounding it is clear and you can see the animals up close from your resort. <br>
        The resort has a view of the beach making it a perfect vacation for you and your familiy.<br> 
        The sound of waves that clash against the beach and makes it calming to the mind which is what you would want from a vacation. <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        The Maldives has a tourist attraction called "The Sea of Stars", at night, the bioluminescent plankton 
        around the ocean turning into a bright blue at night making an illusion of stars. The Sea of Stars at night are present around the shoreline. Due to this 
        the Sea became a great tourist attraction and looks magical in person.
